# Haskel Z80 CPU-Board programming

Here is the example and test assembly programs for the [Z80 CPU Boards](../CPU-BOARD) recovered from an old DTMF Phone central.

![Z80 DTMF CENTRAL](docs/Z80-DTMF-central.jpg)

## Main board modification

**The main board have been tuned a bit to avoids CPU-BOARD chip selection for unused address range** that may now be used on custom expansion boards.

![modif-addressing-00](docs/modif-addressing-00.jpg)

![modif-addressing-01](docs/modif-addressing-01.jpg)

**The NE556 has been removed to avoids the WatchDog to take place** and continuously resets the board if not properly feeded.

Schematics and details are available in the [/CPU-BOARD](../CPU-BOARD) folder.

## CPU Add-on board

![CPU-BOARD-ADDON-assembly](docs/CPU-BOARD-ADDON-assembly.jpg)

The created [CPU-BOARD-ADDON](../CPU-BOARD-ADDON) is used togheter with the CPU-BOARD and some code examples. **The CPU-BOARD-ADDON will allow primarily user interaction** with few ASM instructions where the CPU-BOARD have currently no way at all (no LED, no serial, no button) to interact with the user.

Schematics and details are available in the [/CPU-BOARD-ADDON](../CPU-BOARD-ADDON)

# Dev environment

Here how to install the **z80asm assembler** on Linux based Operating system.
It can be used with a [Makefile](test/Makefile) to compile the binaries.

```
sudo apt install z80asm
```
More information on z80asm can be found at [z80asm manpage @ Ubuntu](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/xenial/man1/z80asm.1.html).


Additional tool that may be useful to inspect generated binary file.

```
sudo apt install hexedit
```

A **programmer is also required** to program the EEPROM.
XGecu can be used and this also run under Linux :-) .

![XGecu programmer](docs/xgecu.jpg)

* [XGecu under linux](https://wiki.mchobby.be/index.php?title=XGecu-install-Linux) (_French_)<br />How to install and run it under Linux with Wine.
* [XGecu pratical](https://wiki.mchobby.be/index.php?title=XGecu-EEPROM) (_French_)<br />Explain how to read the ROMs and program the EEPROM for this project.



# Programming principle
1. The ASM test program is compiled to a binary file.
2. The binary is transfered to an EEPROM
3. the EEPROM is placed on CPU-BOARD (replace the ROM with RED label)

The binaries (.bin) are compiled with the **make world** utility using the Makefile to compile all the example at binaries.

```
cd test
make world
```
# Tests & Examples

The [test sub-folder](test) contains many examples in assembler used to test the various features of the CPU-BOARD and CPU-BOARD-ADDON.

## 01_minimal.asm
This is the minimal user interaction we can expect... lighting a LED.

This example will lit the four right-most LEDs (bits 0 to 4).

The code is quite simple and makes an OUT to peripheral $1D (the LEDs)

```
org     0x0000          ; Cold reset Z80 entry point.

loop:
  ld a, $0f    ; Lit LED 0, 1, 2, 3
  out ($1d),a  ; LED port
  jp loop
```
Which produces the following results on the board.

![minimal ASM example](docs/minimal.jpg)

## 02_in_out.asm
This second example improve interaction by getting user input.

The example detects the pressed buttons and lit the corresponding LEDs.

The code uses a IN to read value from peripheral ($1C) THEN uses OUT to send the value to peripheral $1D .

```
org     0x0000          ; Cold reset Z80 entry point.

loop:
  in a,($1c)   ; Read buttons
  out ($1d),a  ; Apply to LEDs
  jp loop
```
Which produces the following results on the board.

![In Out ASM example](docs/in_out.jpg)

## 03_pio.asm
This example will configure the port A of PIO1 as output then manipulates output PA0 to PA2 (of the 8 output available).

![Z80 board PIO1](docs/z80-board-pio.jpg)

To check the changes, we do connect LEDs+resistor to the PIO lines made available on the port P1.

The pin name of port P1 (see picture below) are labelled as follow:
* p1.PA0 means PIO 1, port A, I/O 0 (PA0).
* p3.PB4 means PIO 3, port B, I/O 4 (PB4).

![port P1 pinout](docs/pio-p1-port.jpg)

Where the [full schematics of the CPU-Board](../CPU-BOARD/docs) gives more details about pinout and adresses.

![Z80 PIO 1 pinout and schematic](docs/pio1-select.jpg)

On the image above, the pins state to modify (PA0..PA2 of PIO 1) are visible on the top right of the image. Those are the signal wired to the P1 connector.

### Let's decode addresses

To manage the output, we have to control the following inputs on PIO 1:
* **B/<span style="text-decoration:overline">A</span>** feeded with a0
* **C/<span style="text-decoration:overline">D</span>** feeded with a1
* **<span style="text-decoration:overline">CE</span>** feeded with _PIO1ce

The PIO1 is activated when the <span style="text-decoration:overline">CE</span> signal is LOW. This signal comes from the <span style="text-decoration:overline">Y2</span> output of IC16 chip which must be LOW!

The <span style="text-decoration:overline">Y2</span> is LOW when input pins presents the input value 0b010 (less significative bit right). That finally means that **a4,a3,a2** = **0,1,0** .

The PIO 1 **B/<span style="text-decoration:overline">A</span>** (pin 6) feeded with a0. So when a0 is LOW, the Port A of the PIO is selected.

We have address **a4,a3,a2,a1,a0** = **0,1,0,a1,0** we will manage the PortA of PIO 1. **a5 to a7** are obviously to LOW.

Finally, the **a1** level will allows:
* when HIGH ==> send command C to PIO
* when LOW ==> send data <span style="text-decoration:overline">D</span> to PIO.

So:
* address 0b000_010_00 = 8  = 0x08 --> send data on Port A of PIO 1.
* address 0b000_010_10 = 10 = 0x0A --> send command on Port A of PIO 1.

### Assembly code

Prior to explore the assembly code, let introduce the ***io.asm*** source wich contains definitions of constants.

```
; --- PIO ---
; eg: PIO2_BASE+PIO_PORTB+PIO_CMD
PIO1_BASE:  equ  0x08 ; Base port for PIO1
PIO2_BASE:  equ  0x00
PIO3_BASE:  equ  0x0C

PIO_PORTA:  equ  0x00 ; to append to PIOx_BASE
PIO_PORTB:  equ  0x01

PIO_DATA:   equ  0x00 ; to append to PIOx_BASE
PIO_CMD:    equ  0x02

; --- RCIO ---
RCIO_OUTPUT:  equ  0x1D
RCIO_INPUT:   equ  0x1C
```
The assembly code here below just:
1. Load the ***io.asm*** .
2. Reset le LEDs on the RCIO expansion board.
3. Configure port A on PIO1 as output (mode 0).
4. Activate the output PA0 et PA1 (see the binary value 00000101).
5. Turn ON the last LED on the RCIO expansion board.<br />So we know that code have been executed. It is even visible on the sample picture at the begin of this point.

```
; 03_pio.asm
include 'io.asm'

org     0x0000               ; Cold reset Z80 entry point.

main:
    ld a, $00                ; all LEDs OFF
    out (RCIO_OUTPUT), a

    ld a,$0F                 ; set mode 0 (output)
    out (PIO1_BASE+PIO_PORTA+PIO_CMD),a

    ; set
    ld a,%00000101           ; set PA0 & PA2 high
    out (PIO1_BASE+PIO_PORTA+PIO_DATA),a

    ld a, $80                ; Lit LED D7
    out (RCIO_OUTPUT),a      
    halt
```

## 04_pio_read.asm
This example follows the preceding one (so read it first).

This time we will configure the port B of PIO1 as INPUT then read the state of a button wired on PB7 (among the 8 inputs available).
